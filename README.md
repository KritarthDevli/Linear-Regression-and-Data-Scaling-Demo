# Linear-Regression-and-Data-Scaling-Demo

## About
A beginner-friendly Python project demonstrating **data preprocessing** and **linear regression**. This project uses a small dataset of study hours and test scores to showcase how **feature scaling** (StandardScaler & MinMaxScaler) affects model training and prediction. It is ideal for beginners learning machine learning pipelines and preprocessing techniques.

## Features
- **Linear Regression:** Predicts test scores based on study hours.
- **StandardScaler:** Standardizes features to zero mean and unit variance.
- **MinMaxScaler:** Normalizes features to a range [0,1].
- Demonstrates the importance of scaling for ML models.
- Easy-to-understand code using `pandas` and `scikit-learn`.
